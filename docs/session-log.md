# Thesis State — Current Code-Side Source of Truth

> Last updated: 2026-04-08.
> Use `docs/authoritative-numbers.md` and `code/utils/extract_all_numbers.R` for exact thesis numbers.
> This file is the condensed continuity summary for future sessions.

## 1. Status

- **Phase 1-3**: complete.
- **Phase 4**: chapter `.tex` propagation and thesis-level revision are complete against the verified 2026-04-07 / 2026-04-08 state.
- **Current blocker**: one final fresh-eyes adversarial review for numeric traceability, overclaim / underclaim, redundancy, and any remaining defense vulnerabilities.

### Source Hierarchy
1. `docs/authoritative-numbers.md`
2. `code/utils/extract_all_numbers.R`
3. `output/models/*.rds` and `output/tables/tab_model_performance.tex`
4. `CLAUDE.md`
5. Historical planning / verification docs only for background, not for current numbers

## 2. Locked Analytical State

### Data and Coding
- **Cohort**: 12,968 securities class actions (NOS 850), 1990-2024, from FJC IDB.
- **Pipeline counts**: 65,899 -> 13,708 -> 12,968.
- **Scheme A**: 3,801 settlement / 5,971 dismissal / 3,196 censored.
- **Scheme B**: 5,605 settlement / 4,167 dismissal / 3,196 censored.
- **Scheme C**: 5,919 settlement / 4,167 dismissal / 2,882 censored.
- **Judgment-bearing dispositions**: `disp %in% {4, 6, 15, 17, 19, 20}` use `JUDGMENT` consistently.
- **Statistical closings**: `disp = 18` is censored in all schemes.
- **Origin factor**: `origin_cat == "Removed"` is collapsed into `"Other"` globally.

### Model Specification
- **Extended formula**: `post_pslra + circuit_f + origin_cat + mdl_flag + juris_fq + stat_basis_f`
- `stat_basis_f` missing values are retained as explicit `"Missing"` in the extended sample.
- `mdl_flag` stays out of the propensity score model because pre-PSLRA MDL cases are structurally absent.
- Linear `filing_year` is banned. Only the spline robustness specification `ns(filing_year, df = 3)` is used.

### Fine-Gray and Verification
- Fine-Gray models use subject-level clustering with `cluster = case_id`.
- Saved Fine-Gray `coxph` objects now retain `x`, `y`, and `model`, so `cox.zph()` works after reload from `output/models/fine_gray_models.rds`.
- `code/utils/extract_all_numbers.R` is now verified on the **saved-model branch**, not only the Fine-Gray refit fallback.
- Fine-Gray sample size should be reported as **`N = 12,866` cases**, not the finegray-expanded row count.

### Language Discipline
- Use **"associated with"** for Cox and Fine-Gray.
- Use **"composition-adjusted"** or **"after adjusting for observable case composition"** for IPTW.
- Do **not** describe IPTW results as causal.
- Constant-HR models are time-averaged summaries because PH is violated.

## 4. Writing State and Remaining Watch Items

### Headline Writing Rules
- Lead dismissal claims with the IPTW MSM dismissal estimate (`HR = 1.519`) rather than the spline extreme.
- Report robustness ranges as settlement `[0.558, 1.052]` and dismissal `[1.183, 3.515]`.
- State clearly that extended cluster-robust settlement is **not significant**.
- Report that both outcomes violate PH; do not describe the constant-HR models as fully time-invariant.
- Report Fine-Gray honestly: stronger causal-composition contrast for settlement, but weaker discrimination than Cox.

### Chapter State as of 2026-04-08
- No core chapter should be treated as presumptively stale.
- `writing/chapters/abstract.tex`, `writing/chapters/intro.tex`, `writing/chapters/litreview.tex`, `writing/chapters/methodology.tex`, `writing/chapters/data.tex`, `writing/chapters/results.tex`, `writing/chapters/discussion.tex`, and `writing/chapters/conclusion.tex` were reread and aligned to the refreshed outputs.
- The discussion now carries the Code 6 / `93.4%` judgment-bearing asymmetry as a limitation; the conclusion only cross-references that limitation.
- The results chapter now includes the settlement-side piecewise table and narrative, plus the Fine-Gray PH diagnostics.

### Do Not Reintroduce
- old Scheme A event shares (`20.9 / 67.3 / 11.7`)
- old Cox numbers (`0.445`, `1.468`, `0.702`, `1.751`)
- old Fine-Gray numbers (`0.454`, `1.864`)
- old robustness ranges (`[1.32, 2.45]` dismissal; `[0.44, 0.98]` settlement)
- any claim that extended cluster-robust settlement remains significant
- any prose that treats judgment-bearing coding as a Code-6-only issue
- any causal language stronger than the locked discipline above

### Remaining Review Targets
- unnecessary within- and cross-chapter repetition, especially `results -> discussion -> conclusion`
- overclaim on the settlement side
- underclaim or omission in limitations / diagnostics integration
- any number in prose that cannot be traced to the current source hierarchy
- final submission polish: citations, figure readability, and `writing/chapters/acknow.tex`

### Final Non-Code Item
- `writing/chapters/acknow.tex` still needs Andrew's personal text.

## 5. Next Steps

1. Run one final adversarial thesis-level review from a fresh chat with strict source hierarchy and no presumption that the prose is correct.
2. Verify any remaining prose-level numbers that are challenged or appear weakly sourced.
3. Resolve any final overclaim, underclaim, missing limitation, or redundancy issues surfaced by that review.
4. Finish submission polish: citations, figure readability, formatting, and `writing/chapters/acknow.tex`.

## 6. Recent History (Condensed)

### 2026-04-06
- fixed judgment-bearing disposition coding across `{4, 6, 15, 17, 19, 20}`
- censored `DISP = 18` globally
- collapsed `origin_cat == "Removed"` into `"Other"`
- added `case_id` and carried it into Fine-Gray clustering

### 2026-04-07
- reran the full authoritative analysis pipeline and refreshed diagnostics outputs
- refreshed `output/tables/tab_model_performance.tex`
- regenerated `output/models/fine_gray_models.rds`
- reconciled `docs/authoritative-numbers.md`, `code/utils/extract_all_numbers.R`, and the saved Fine-Gray artifact

### 2026-04-08
- verified the `93.4%` Code 6 asymmetry directly from the saved cleaned cohort artifact: `655 / 701` post-PSLRA plaintiff-victory reclassifications
- verified and integrated Fine-Gray PH diagnostics (`54.92`, `1.25e-13`; `11.78`, `5.97e-04`) into the results diagnostics section
- verified and integrated the settlement-side piecewise PSLRA results (`0.518`, `0.387`, `0.673`) into the results chapter with matching prose
- corrected stale methodology / results language, including baseline model description and interaction examples
- rebalanced the thesis so dismissal remains the strongest defended claim and settlement is described as materially more fragile
- performed a full-thesis redundancy pass; tightened `intro`, `litreview`, `results`, `discussion`, and `conclusion`
- moved the Code 6 asymmetry discussion out of `conclusion.tex` future directions and into `discussion.tex` limitations, leaving only a cross-reference in the conclusion
